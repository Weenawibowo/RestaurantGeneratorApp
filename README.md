# My Personal Project

## Restaurant Generator 


### What will the application do? 
This program will basically help you to decide where to go eat! It will check a few details on 
your preference (such as: type of cuisine, rating, location) then it will give you the restaurant options. 

### Who will use it? 
Anyone! It should be open for anyone that wants to use it. 

### Why is this project of interest to you? 
I got my inspiration from myself and my boyfriend, most often we have troubles deciding where to 
go for food, and one day I just wish I could make a program that I can actually use and helpful to me. 
But this project is also interesting because it is fun to make! I can as many restaurants as I would like, 
view my options, and choose one based on my preferences from all the options .

### Phase 4: Task 3
- If I had more time to work on the project, I would try to refactor my AddRestaurants and ChooseRestaurants because
both classes are very similar in terms of the text fields, frame, buttons, so I could probably just combine both 
buttons into one instead of having 2 separate buttons. Additionally, inside the AddRestaurants, there are a bunch of 
helpers with different prompts. I would love to refactor those as well.
